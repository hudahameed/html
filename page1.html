		<h2>Parents</h2>
		<p> I live with both of my parents. My mother’s name is Iffat Hameed and my father’s name is Abdul Hameed. 
			I have nice and stable relationships with both my parents. I’m really thankful to be their daughter. 
			They care for me a lot and always give me the best life possible.
			My dad is a diplomat which means that he works for the Pakistani government. He’s funny, smart and head-strong. 
		 	He likes reading and poetry. I get a bit of my sense of humour from him. My mom is a stay at home mom for now. 
		 	She used to be a teacher back in Pakistan. She is the most caring person you’ll ever meet. She’s hilarious and optimistic. 
		 	I like to go to her to vent and talk about my problems and then afterwards go to my dad for comedic relief sometimes. I got most of my sense of humour from him.

		<h2>Siblings</h2>
		<img src = "images/sarah.JPG" width = "300" height = "400" class = "imageright" alt = "sis">
		<p> I am the middle child of three kids. It explains a lot about why I am the way that I am. 
			The middle child is always said to be the one who gets no attention. However, that is not true, most of the time. 
			For me, I will either be getting the most attention from my parents or the least. 
			Depending on what type of day it is or what is going on. I have an older sister, Sarah. She studies at the University of Toronto.
			I have a younger brother, Salman. He is in third grade. They are the ones who keep me calm and down to earth. 
			We move around a lot and so can’t have friends who are physically capable of being there for me, so it’s important to get along with them.
			I don’t get along with Salman as much I do with Sarah. This is because he is more annoying than Sarah. 
			Both of us are in the process of growing up. I didn’t even get along with Sarah up until her last year of high school. </p>
