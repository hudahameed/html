		<h1>Me :)</h1>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>On a weekly basis I like to practice on my keyboard.</li>
			<li>I’ve become very skilled at skateboarding over quarantine.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>How I spend my free time</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I really like music . Mostly songs that are unique, I don't usually listen to the songs they put on the radio. 
				My favourite genre is indie, in English and Hindi/Urdu.</li>
			<li>I watch Pakistani dramas serials with my mom and sister whenever I get time.</li>
			<li>We also bake as a family sometimes over the weekend.</li>
			<li>I try to keep in touch with my old friends over the weekend as I don’t get time over the week and time zones don’t help out either.
			 	The time difference between Canada and India is 10 and a half hours and 10 with Pakistan (they are ahead of us).</li>
			<li>My family and I go out for ice cream! Our favourite ice cream place is Dutch Dreams in Vaughan!</li>
			<li>My favourite show is Avatar the Last Airbender! I’ve rewatched it more times than I could count! </li>
			<li>I try to catch up on my Urdu reading and writing whenever I get time.</li>
			<li>I like to look at memes to light up my day!</li>
			<li>My favourite thing to eat are Pakistani ramen noodles.</li>
			<li>I like going on walks during fall and exploring in mountainous areas.</li>
			<li>I like taking poems and have a little interest in photography</li>
