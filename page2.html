		<h1>Friends</h1>
		<h2>New York</h2>
		<img src = "images/india.JPG" alt = "indian friends" width = "500" height = "300" class = "imageright">
		<p> I started school in New York, I attended a nice preschool on the west side of manhattan. 
			It was a nice small preschool and I met friends who even lived only a building away from me. 
			I do not remember much as I was pretty young. I got bullied quite a bit in second grade but things worked out okay. 
			I also left New York that year. 
		</p>
		<h2>Pakistan</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lodges: This is the place where I lived, as most Pakistani diplomats are appointed to. 
				The lodges were a small version of a colony. I met many kids who I am still in touch with today, 
				they also moved around a lot across the world so got me. I made long-lasting friendships in the lodges.
				We used to spend all our days playing outside. There was also a little tuck shop we could get snacks from so life was easy. 
				We didn’t have many responsibilities. After all, I was only in 3rd and 4th grade throughout my stay, in Islamabad, Pakistan. 
				Most of my friends were one or two years older than me but I’ve always seemed to get along with older kids due to my having an older sister.
				I had one friend however who was the same age as me, in the same class and she took the same bus as me. 
				We were always seen together except when we fought (which was quite often).</li>
			<li>School: The school I went to was a very new experience for me as I had never really properly interacted with normal Pakistani kids. 
				I was very scared when I first started, as my experiences from the year before in school were not medal-worthy. 
				I was scared that I would come off as too whitewashed or lonely and helpless. 
				I was also expected to learn how to read and write in Urdu, a whole new language! However, I felt very at home and confident when I went there. 
				Everyone was super nice and funny. I found another best friend who I just recently reconnected with in April!</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>India</h2>
		<p>	I did my 5th-7th grade in India. I feel as if these are the main years in which I transitioned into being a teenager and more mature. 
			Overall, I made a lot of good friends through the course of my last 2 years. The first year was a lot of fun with my classmates however I did not have many friends.
		 	I spent most of my time trying to fit in with the cool kids. Eventually, they began to accept me into their friend group and by grade 6, I was a prominent part of it. 
		 	I very slowly realized that most of them backbit about each other and they really weren’t friends. 
		 	I realized that I wasn’t the only one who felt this way and thus became friends with them. We all grew closer and thankfully we ended up in the same class in grade 7.
		 	Grade 7 was really fun because it was just me and my REAL friends having fun together and making unforgettable memories. 
		 	I still call one of them every single day. I have my friend soulmate and I do not hope to lose her anytime soon.</p>
		<h2>Canada</h2>
		<img src = "images/canada.JPG" alt = "canadian friends" width = "400" height = "500" class = "imageleft">
		<p> I moved to Canada last year. I have done grade 8 and now one quad of grade 9 :) I didn’t try to be very social or repeat my mistakes from grade 6. 
			I let whoever I talked to or became friends with to come naturally. In the beginning of the year, this “friend” of mine was quite mean and controlling even though I tried to fight against it. 
			She made me feel bad about myself and always did no work when she forced me to be her partner in group work. It was nice when she finally told me she was moving in November. 
			That was perfect as it was around the time high school entrance exams started so I had a clear mind to study. Additionally, by that time, I had also become friends with this other girl in my class. 
			My other friend who later on moved, wouldn’t let us hang out together before. She was very possessive. When she left, I was getting good grades and branched out my friend group. 
			I never really socialized with kids outside of my class as I was aware of the fact that we were all gonna be in different places by next year. Inside my class, I was friendly towards everyone. 
			I’ve made another life long best friend. However, in total I've made quite a few friends who I talk to regularly since high school has started. </p>
